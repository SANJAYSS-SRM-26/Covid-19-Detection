# Covid-19-Detection

## Description:
This repository contains code for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using transfer learning with the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of chest X-ray images of COVID-19 positive and negative cases. Transfer learning is employed to leverage the pre-trained weights of the VGG16 model trained on the ImageNet dataset.

The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing functionalities. Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset and enhance the model's generalization capabilities. The performance of the trained model is evaluated on both training and testing datasets using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Run the code:
`python covid_detection.py`
